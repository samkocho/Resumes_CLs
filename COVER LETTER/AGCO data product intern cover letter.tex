\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for


I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Data Product Intern position at 
AGCO, as advertised. With a strong academic background in statistics 
and data science, coupled with practical experience in predictive machine 
learning models, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to AGCO's 
mission of addressing global challenges in agriculture and climate change.

As a current undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Statistics at the 
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I have developed a deep understanding 
of data analytics and its applications in solving real-world problems. 
My internship experience as an ATLAS Machine Learning Intern, where I 
developed predictive machine learning models using Python, has equipped 
me with the technical skills and expertise required to excel in this role. 
Leveraging advanced techniques such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and Regression
 models, I have gained valuable insights from complex datasets, which I believe
  will be beneficial in defining and communicating AGCO's Telemetry Data Product.

I am particularly drawn to AGCO's commitment to innovation and sustainability 
in agriculture. The opportunity to collaborate with industry experts at the 
AGCO Acceleration Center to develop possible future business use cases and 
document requirements aligns perfectly with my academic background and 
career aspirations. I am eager to leverage my skills in PowerPoint 
to create effective communication materials that will contribute to 
the success of AGCO's initiatives.

Furthermore, my experience as a Course Assistant for STAT107 
has enhanced my ability to facilitate learning and collaborate 
effectively with diverse teams, qualities that I believe are 
essential for success in this role. While I do not have previous
 work experience as a consultant or data scientist, I am confident 
 in my ability to quickly adapt and contribute positively to the team.

I am excited about the opportunity to join AGCO as a Data Product 
Intern and make a meaningful contribution to the company's mission
 of feeding the world's growing population while addressing climate 
 change. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to 
 the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with 
 the needs of AGCO.
