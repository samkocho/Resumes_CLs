\opening{Dear Ms. Arnold,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for

I am writing to express my interest in the proctor position at the Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF) for Fall 2024. As a junior majoring in Statistics and minoring in Math at UIUC, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to maintaining a fair and efficient testing environment for my fellow students.

Having grown up in a multicultural environment and being fluent in Korean, Spanish, and English, I have developed excellent communication skills and the ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. This will be particularly beneficial in addressing student concerns and ensuring a calm testing environment.

My experience as a former soldier in the Korean Army has instilled in me the importance of punctuality, organization, and following procedures. These attributes, combined with my leadership roles as a Course Assistant for STAT107 and my internship experiences, have honed my ability to manage responsibilities effectively and engage actively with both students and staff.

One high-stress situation I handled effectively was during my tenure as a Finance Unit Supply Manager in the 176th Financial Management Support Unit in the Korean Army. I was tasked with managing over \$14,000 worth of inventory and ensuring that all supplies were accounted for accurately. During a routine audit, I discovered a significant discrepancy in our inventory records, which had the potential to disrupt our operations and impact our unitâ€™s readiness.

To resolve this, I quickly organized a team meeting to address the issue. I delegated specific tasks to each team member, assigning them to cross-check inventory records, verify physical counts, and identify any possible errors in documentation. My role involved overseeing the process, ensuring accuracy, and maintaining clear communication with higher command to keep them informed of our progress and to manage their expectations.

This experience taught me the importance of staying composed under pressure, using systematic approaches to solve problems, and the value of clear communication and teamwork in resolving crises.

am confident that my background, skills, and dedication make me a strong candidate for the proctor position at the CBTF. I am eager to contribute to creating a positive and equitable testing experience for students and faculty alike. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experiences align with the needs of the CBTF.

\closing{Sincerely,
