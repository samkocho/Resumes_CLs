\opening{Dear Dr. Lucic,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the part-time summer internship position focused on constructing a dataset to develop a computational model that infers the structural boundaries of fiction and nonfiction works in the HathiTrust Research Center repository. With a strong background in statistics, mathematics, and practical experience in data science, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to this project.

My recent internship at ATLAS Machine Learning further strengthened my expertise in predictive modeling and data analysis. During this internship, I worked on a project called the Titanic Machine Learning Model where I eveloped a predictive model with 87\% accuracy using Python to determine factors influencing survival rates in the Titanic disaster using passenger data. Employed various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, alongside hyperparameter tuning to build predictive models. Ranked 1518th out of 16,078 submissions.

Although I do not have extensive experience with Linux-based environments, I am a fast learner with a strong willingness to acquire new skills. My eagerness to embrace new technologies and adapt quickly to new tools will ensure that I can effectively navigate the secure data capsule provided by the HathiTrust Research Center.

I have also earned the Coursera Business Analytics Specialization through which I have gained proficiency in business analytics, data analysis, machine learning, statistical programming in R, and natural language processing (NLP).

Having grown up in diverse cultural settings in Honduras and Nicaragua, I bring a unique perspective and a strong adaptability to new environments and challenges. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in a project that intersects my interests in data science and textual analysis, and I am particularly eager to work within the secure data capsule provided by the HathiTrust Research Center.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm align with the goals of your project. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience to schedule an interview.
