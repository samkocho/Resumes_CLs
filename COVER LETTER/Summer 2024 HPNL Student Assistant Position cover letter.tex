\opening{Dear Michelle Self-Ballard,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for


I am excited to apply for the Summer 2024 HPNL Student Assistant Position. 

As a multicultural individual born in Honduras and raised in Nicaragua, I have developed exceptional adaptability 
and communication skills that enable me to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
 Additionally, my proficiency in Korean, Spanish, and English further enhances my ability to 
 engage with patrons from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment at the library.

My experience as a former soldier in the Korean Army has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, 
organization, and efficiency. As a Finance Unit Supply Manager, I successfully orchestrated 
inventory management operations, overseeing supplies worth over \$14,000 while ensuring compliance and accountability.
 This experience, coupled with my current role as an ATLAS Machine Learning Intern at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
 has honed my attention to detail and ability to follow procedures meticulously.

 Moreover, my experience as a Course Assistant for STAT107 has equipped me with valuable teaching
  and cross-team collaboration skills, facilitating learning for over 1000 students and managing learning platform modifications.

I am also flexible and adaptable, able to work varied schedules throughout the summer
 to accommodate the library's needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm 
to the HPNL team and contribute to the library's mission of serving the academic community. 

\closing{Sincerely,
