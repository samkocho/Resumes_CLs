\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for


I am writing to express my strong interest in the Math Teacher 
position at Avenues Online. With a robust background in statistics, 
data analytics, and mathematics, coupled with my experience in teaching 
and mentoring students, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute 
to Avenues Online's mission of fostering deep and innovative 
learning experiences for students across the globe.

As a Course Assistant for STAT107 at the University of Illinois 
Urbana-Champaign, I facilitated learning for over 1000 students, 
assisting them in grasping fundamental data science concepts 
and conducting interactive sessions to enhance their understanding.
 My role involved collaborating with a diverse team of staff and professors, 
 managing learning platform modifications, and ensuring a seamless 
 learning experience for students. This experience honed my 
 communication skills and deepened my commitment to creating 
 an inclusive and engaging learning environment.

Furthermore, my previous experience as a Teacher at Nanum School in 
Nicaragua provided me with firsthand experience in teaching math
 and English to a group of children aged 5-12 in an impoverished sector. 
 I organized fun activities, provided individualized support, 
 and fostered a sense of belonging among the students, emphasizing 
 the importance of education and community engagement.

In addition to my teaching experiences, I am pursuing a Math minor 
at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This coursework has 
provided me with a solid foundation in mathematical principles which I 
am eager to apply in a virtual classroom setting.

I am particularly drawn to the problem-based mathematics 
pedagogy embraced by Avenues Online, which encourages 
students to master mathematical concepts gradually through 
hands-on learning and collaborative inquiry. I am excited 
about the prospect of leading one-on-one tutoring sessions, 
facilitating collaborative lab sessions, and co-constructing 
an environment that upholds the values of welcome, safety, and respect.

In addition to my technical skills, I am deeply committed to creating
 a culture of equity and inclusion, where every student feels valued 
 and empowered to succeed. I am confident that my passion for 
 teaching, coupled with my analytical expertise and dedication 
 to student success, make me a strong fit for the Math Teacher 
 position at Avenues Online.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to the 
Avenues Online community and contribute to its mission 
of transforming online education. I look forward to the
 opportunity to discuss how my experiences align with the 
 needs of your team further.
