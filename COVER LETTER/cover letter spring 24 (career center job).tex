%who are you?


%what are your specific research/teaching interests?
I am writing to express my interest in the Summer 2024 Internship 
with Lenovo's cloud analytics team in Chicago, IL, as advertised.
As a Statistics Junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
with a strong passion
for data science and a solid foundation in predictive machine 
learning models, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute 
to Lenovo's innovative projects.

Lenovo's commitment to delivering smarter technology for all aligns
perfectly with my career aspirations. I am inspired by Lenovo's bold 
vision and its dedication to building a more inclusive and trustworthy 
future through groundbreaking innovation. I am eager to be part of a team 
that shares my values of integrity, accountability, and customer focus.

My experience as an ATLAS Machine Learning Intern and a Course Assistant
for STAT107 has equipped me with the technical skills and practical
knowledge necessary to excel in this role. During my internship, I have
built predictive machine learning models using Python and employed 
various techniques, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and Regression 
models. I have also gained experience in data preprocessing, feature 
engineering, and model optimization. Additionally, my role as a Course 
Assistant has honed my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively 
and collaborate with diverse teams.

Furthermore, my diverse background, including experience as a Management 
Intern and as a Finance Unit Supply Manager in the US 8th Army, has equipped 
me with valuable skills such as project management, teamwork, and problem-solving.
I am confident that my unique blend of technical expertise and real-world
experience will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to Lenovo's
cloud analytics team.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to collaborate with 
Lenovo's talented engineering professionals and gain exposure to Google 
Cloud products like BigQuery. I am committed to learning and adapting to 
new challenges, and I am eager to contribute to the success of Lenovo's
transformative projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity
to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and passion for technology to Lenovo and make a
positive impact on the team. I look forward to the possibility of discussing
how my background and experiences align with the needs of the cloud analytics team.
