\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analytics Intern position at SentinelOne, as advertised. With a strong background in statistics and mathematics, coupled with hands-on experience in predictive modeling and data analysis, I am eager to contribute to SentinelOne's mission of defining the future of cybersecurity through innovative data-driven approaches.

Currently a junior majoring in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I have developed a robust skill set that aligns perfectly with the requirements of the position. My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in statistical methods, analytical techniques, and data manipulation. Additionally, my experience as an ATLAS Machine Learning Intern has honed my abilities in developing predictive machine learning models and collaborating effectively within a team environment.

During my internship at ATLAS, I worked closely with a team of interns and coordinators to develop predictive models using Python, employing advanced techniques such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and Regression models. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my ability to communicate complex findings to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.

Furthermore, my diverse background, including serving as a soldier in the Korean army and interning at KM Internacional S.A., has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, organization, and adaptability. These qualities, combined with my fluency in Korean, Spanish, and English, enable me to thrive in multicultural environments and effectively collaborate with colleagues from diverse backgrounds.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work with SentinelOne's Data, Analytics, Governance & Applied AI Group, where I can leverage my skills to develop statistical methods and models for quantifying metrics that deliver value and drive decisions. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to the development of autonomous protection solutions and helping organizations gain full transparency into their networks to defeat every attack.

In addition to my academic and professional experiences, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and staying abreast of industry trends and best practices in statistics and data analysis. I am confident that my passion for data, strong analytical skills, and dedication to excellence make me a valuable addition to the SentinelOne team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to the success of SentinelOne.
