%I am writing to be considered for


I am writing to express my interest in the Implementation Specialist Internship position at Sievo as advertised. With a strong background in data science and hands-on experience in predictive machine learning models, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and gain valuable industry experience at Sievo.

Currently a Statistics Junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I have been deeply involved in applying statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. My recent internship as an ATLAS Machine Learning Intern has honed my skills in developing predictive models using Python and advanced techniques such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and Regression models. Collaborating closely with a team, I have demonstrated my ability to align project goals, track progress, and deliver impactful results. Additionally, my role as a Course Assistant for STAT107 has enhanced my teaching and cross-team collaboration skills, further reinforcing my ability to work effectively in a team environment.

Furthermore, my experience as a Management Intern at KM Internacional S.A. and my service in the US 8th Army Korean Augmentation have equipped me with strong organizational skills, teamwork, and adaptability. I have a proven track record of driving operational efficiency, leading teams, and fostering collaboration across diverse settings. These experiences have instilled in me a strong work ethic, resilience, and a passion for solving complex problems.

I am particularly drawn to Sievo's commitment to innovation, hands-on learning opportunities, and diverse work culture. I am eager to leverage my skills and contribute to the development of Sievo applications, working closely with customers to understand their procurement analytics needs and delivering solutions that drive business growth.

I am confident that my background and skill set make me a strong candidate for the Implementation Specialist Internship at Sievo. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to learn from and contribute to your team and look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can make a meaningful impact during the summer internship program.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to Sievo's success. Please find my resume attached for your review. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview.
