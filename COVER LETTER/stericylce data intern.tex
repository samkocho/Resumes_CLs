\opening{Dear Stericycle Talent Acquisition team,}
%say what job are you are for:
%I am writing to express my interest in 
%I am writing to be considered for

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Data Analytics 
Internship position at Stericycle, as advertised. With a fervent
 passion for data science and a solid foundation in predictive 
 modeling, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to 
 Stericycle's mission of protecting health and well-being in a 
 safe, responsible, and sustainable way.

As a Statistics Junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
I have dedicated myself
 to exploring the intricacies of data analysis and machine learning. 
 My recent internship as an ATLAS Machine Learning Intern has provided 
 me with invaluable experience in developing predictive machine learning 
 models using Python. Collaborating closely with a multidisciplinary team
 , I utilized advanced techniques such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and 
 Regression models to derive actionable insights from complex datasets. 
 These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also
  honed my ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively 
  towards common goals.

In addition to my technical skills, my role as a Course Assistant
 for STAT107 has further strengthened my ability to facilitate
  learning and collaborate with diverse teams. I have had the 
  privilege of assisting over 1000 students in grasping fundamental
   data science concepts, conducting interactive sessions, and managing
    learning platform modifications. My experience as a Management Intern 
    at KM Internacional S.A. has equipped me with valuable project management
     skills and a strong sense of accountability, further complementing my 
     ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment.

What excites me most about the opportunity at Stericycle is
 the chance to leverage my skills and expertise to contribute to
  innovative solutions that protect the environment, people, and 
  public health. Stericycle's commitment to fostering an inclusive 
  culture where team members feel welcome, valued, and heard resonates 
  deeply with me, and I am eager to contribute to a diverse and 
  collaborative environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the
 opportunity to join Stericycle and contribute to your team. I am 
 confident that my blend of technical proficiency, collaborative 
 spirit, and passion for data science make me a strong candidate 
 for this position. I look forward to the possibility of discussing 
 how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your organization.
